# Your Ask box's rules

This is the uvularia **rules** template — the `<org>-ask-rules` repository. It
holds everything that shapes *how your Ask box answers*, and nothing that shapes
*what is true*. The facts live in your records vault; this repository is the box's
instructions, its policy, its manual overrides, and the golden set of questions
that gate every change to them.

That separation is the whole point. A change here can reword the box or take it
offline; it can never edit a record. A change to a record can never edit a rule.
The two repositories have different reviewers and different blast radii on
purpose.

You do not need to be a programmer to run it. You edit a Markdown file or a short
policy file and open a pull request; the checks run on their own.

---

## 1. Use this template

**What you are about to do:** make your own copy of the rules repository in your
GitHub organization and point it at your records vault.

**Why bother:** this is the one repository that governs the assistant. Setting its
reviewers and its published corpus URL once is what lets every later change — a
reworded instruction, a new refusal, a postponed-meeting notice — be a reviewed,
reversible pull request.

**How long:** about ten minutes.

1. Click **Use this template → Create a new repository**. Name it
   `<your-org>-ask-rules`. It can be public.
2. In [`policy.yaml`](policy.yaml), set `published_base` to your records vault's
   published URL (for example `https://<your-org>.github.io/<your-org>-records`).
   The box and the eval gate both read `corpus-latest.json` from there.
3. Set your reviewers in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) (replace the
   placeholder), then in **Settings → Branches** add a protection rule for `main`:
   require a pull request and require the **evals** status check to pass.
4. Read [`instructions.md`](instructions.md) and, if you like, name your
   organization in it. Read [`policy.yaml`](policy.yaml) and trim the
   `allowed_subjects` and `refusal_classes` to your organization.
5. Merge your first change (even just the edits above). The **release** workflow
   tags `rules-v1` and attaches `policy.yaml` and `instructions.md` as the
   release your Ask function pins.

**How you know it worked:** pull requests show a green **evals** check, and your
**Releases** page has a `rules-v1` with the two files attached.

## 2. What is in here

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`instructions.md`](instructions.md) | the **frozen system block** — the first thing the model reads, ahead of your records. How the box decides, and the rules that do not bend. |
| [`policy.yaml`](policy.yaml) | allowed subjects, refusal classes, the not-legal-advice disclaimer, the daily cap, the model pin, the `enabled` kill switch, and your records vault's published URL. |
| [`signals/incidents.toml`](signals/incidents.toml) | the manual override — declare a postponed meeting or a closed trail and the box leads with it until you clear it. |
| [`evals/golden.jsonl`](evals/golden.jsonl) | the questions the box must get right, with their expected outcome and required citations. See [`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md). |
| [`scripts/telemetry.py`](scripts/telemetry.py) | describes each evals run and release for the optional pipeline events (see **Watch the pipeline**); does nothing unless you set it up. |

### The kill switch

`enabled: false` in [`policy.yaml`](policy.yaml), merged and released, takes the
box down cleanly: it returns a short maintenance line and answers nothing until
you set it back. It is the fastest lever you have and it needs no code change.

---

## 3. Change the box, safely

**What you are about to do:** reword an instruction, add a refusal, or add a
question to the golden set, and see the effect before it ships.

**Why bother:** an assistant breaks quietly. A pull request here re-runs the whole
golden set against your **currently published** corpus and posts, on the pull
request, what changed in the prompt and what the box now does with each golden
question — so a reviewer reads the effect, not just the wording.

**How long:** a few minutes, plus the check.

1. Edit the file and open a pull request.
2. The **evals** check runs the golden set in **dry** mode — a structural pass
   that needs no API key and must come back clean. If you set the
   `MITCHELLA_API_KEY` secret, it also runs a **live** pass that asks every
   question for real and scores the answers against the threshold in
   `policy.yaml`.
3. Read the comment it posts: the prompt diff (what changed in the instructions
   and policy) and the answer diff (what the box does with each golden question).

**How you know it worked:** the **evals** check is green, the comment shows the
outcomes you expected, and — once merged — a new `rules-vN` release carries the
change. To roll back, pin the previous release.

---

## 4. Watch the pipeline (optional)

**What you are about to do:** send one short event to a free Grafana Cloud account
you own every time the evals run and every time a rules release is cut. Grafana
Cloud is a hosted dashboard service; its log store is called **Loki**.

**Why bother:** you see, in one place with your records vault and your Ask box,
which rules version is live and whether the golden set is holding. **Skip this
if** you don't need it. With nothing set up, both workflows stay green and print
one line: `telemetry not configured`.

**How long:** five minutes if your records vault already sends events (same URL,
same token), about fifteen if not.

1. If you haven't yet, make the free Grafana Cloud stack and the write-only
   (`logs:write`) token. The records vault template's README has the steps under
   **Watch the pipeline**.
2. In this repository, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:
   - on the **Variables** tab, add `LOKI_PUSH_URL` = your Loki URL
     (`https://logs-prod-NNN.grafana.net`);
   - on the **Secrets** tab, add `LOKI_WRITE_TOKEN` = `<instance-id>:<token>`;
   - optionally, add a `LOKI_CLUSTER` variable with your organization's short
     name (the default is this repository's owner, lowercased).

What goes out, through drosera's
[`loki-event`](https://github.com/lentago/drosera/tree/main/.github/actions/loki-event)
step:

| Workflow | Event (`stage`) | What it carries |
|---|---|---|
| evals | `evals` | how many golden questions passed and failed (live if it ran, else dry) |
| release | `rules_released` | the `rules-vN` tag just cut |

No questions, answers, or instructions text are sent, only the counts and the tag.
Sending is **best-effort**: if Grafana is down, the step shows a warning and the
check or release still finishes green.

> **Heads up:** pull requests from a fork never see your secrets, so their evals
> runs send nothing and say so in one line. That's expected.

**How you know it worked:** the next run's log shows
`loki-event: pushed log_source=uvularia_evals …`. In Grafana, under **Explore** →
Loki, `{source="uvularia", pipeline="rules"} | json` lists the event.

The Ask function sends its own events once it's deployed. Its README covers that
setup.

## How releases pin the box

On merge to `main`, [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) tags
`rules-v<N>` and attaches [`policy.yaml`](policy.yaml) and
[`instructions.md`](instructions.md) as release assets. Your Ask function pins a
version and advances only when you cut a new one; rolling back is pinning the
previous `rules-vN`. A release is the unit of "this is how the box behaves now",
and it is reversible.
